<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/Swetlanda/stay-safe-online)

"Stay Safe Online" is a project initiated as part of the Code Institite Hackathon 1. It is intended to provide a real-life learning opportunity to work with others on front end web development.

Working in teams of 3, we have been tasked with creating a website which educates users (children and young adults) on how to stay safe online. This may include avoiding (or dealing with) cyber bullying, identity theft of phishing scams.

There are 6 pre-defined Learning Outcomes defined to allow trainee coders to put their HTML and CSS skills in to practice:

**LO1** Design a static Front-End web application using HTML and CSS based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility and responsivity  

**LO2** Test a Front-End web application through the development, implementation and 
deployment stages  

**LO3** Deploy a Front-End web application to a Cloud platform  

**LO4** Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation  

**LO5** Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub  

**LO6** Use an Agile methodology to plan and design a Front End Web application  

-----------
<br>

Much of the initial design was undertaken using bootstrap, before overlaying bespoke design preferences. 

An agile methodology and principal was employed across 4 days to design and develop the site.

* As a user, I want to watch engaging videos with tutorials or demonstrations on setting up privacy settings.
* As a user, I want a quick way to contact someone for help, such as sending a form.
* As a user, I want to read recent news about cybercrimes and tips on how to stay safe online.Acceptance
* As a child I want to see some tips on cybersecurity so I can read more
* As a developer I want to create Readme file so that people understand easily the website, its purpose and structure
* As a user, I want to read recent news about cybercrimes and tips on how to stay safe online.



## UX
The end user of the website would (primarily) be children. This imapct our design and the intended UK in a number of ways.

### Visuals
Simple, consistent page layouts were used across all three pages.

#### Landing Page
<img src="./assets/images/wireframe1.JPG" alt="Logo" width="180" height="180">

#### Safety Tips Page
<img src="./assets/images/wireframe2.JPG" alt="Logo" width="180" height="180">

#### News Page
<img src="./assets/images/wireframe3.JPG" alt="Logo" width="180" height="180">

### Colour Palette
We selected a bright set of contrasting, attention-grabbing colours which are visually appealing to a younger audience.

### Fonts
Simple, non-cursive fonts were used to ensure good readability for the younger audience.

### Navigation
A simple and familar (but adaptive) navigation framework was used in order to ensure that children could move between the key elements of the site.

<!-- TESTING -->
## Testing
Vigorous testing was undertaken to ensure all features and links work. 

Generic links were used for social medie sites and emails, but these were taken as a "pass".

### Validation
The website and all it's individual pages were validated through HTML and CSS validator.

### Accessibility
This website contains alt text for images and links where appropriate for all users to view and browse the website and also in case any images fail to load, the alt text will display what would have been there so the website is still somewhat usable.
