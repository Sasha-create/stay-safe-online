<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

"Stay Safe Online" is a project initiated as part of the Code Institite Hackathon 1. It is intended to provide a real-life learning opportunity to work with others on front end web development.

Working in teams of 3, we have been tasked with creating a website which educates users (children and young adults) on how to stay safe online. This may include avoiding (or dealing with) cyber bullying, identity theft of phishing scams.

There are 6 pre-defined Learning Outcomes defined to allow trainee coders to put their HTML and CSS skills in to practice:

**LO1** Design a static Front-End web application using HTML and CSS based on the principles of 
user experience design, accessibility and responsivity
**LO2** Test a Front-End web application through the development, implementation and 
deployment stages
**LO3** Deploy a Front-End web application to a Cloud platform
**LO4** Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation
**LO5** Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system 
such as GitHub
**LO6** Use an Agile methodology to plan and design a Front End Web application

Much of the initial design was undertaken using bootstrap, before overlaying bespoke design preferences. 

An agile methodology and principal was employed across 4 days to design and develop the site.
