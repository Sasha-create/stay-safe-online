### Visuals
Simple, consistent page layouts were used across all three pages.

#### Landing Page

#### Safety Tips Page
<img src="./assets/images/wireframe2.JPG" alt="Logo" width="180" height="180">

#### News Page
<img src="./assets/images/wireframe3.JPG" alt="Logo" width="180" height="180">

### Colour Palette
We selected a bright set of contrasting, attention-grabbing colours which are visually appealing to a younger audience.

### Fonts
Simple, non-cursive fonts were used to ensure good readability for the younger audience.

### Navigation
A simple and familar (but adaptive) navigation framework was used in order to ensure that children could move between the key elements of the site.

<!-- TESTING -->
## Testing
Vigorous testing was undertaken to ensure all features and links work. 

Generic links were used for social medie sites and emails, but these were taken as a "pass".

### Validation
The website and all it's individual pages were validated through HTML and CSS validator.

### Accessibility
This website contains alt text for images and links where appropriate for all users to view and browse the website and also in case any images fail to load, the alt text will display what would have been there so the website is still somewhat usable.
